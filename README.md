# Missionaries and Cannibals
 

Missionaries and cannibals problem is a famous toy problem in artificial intelligence. You have one boat, three missionaries and three cannibals. The objective is to move everyone from left bank to right bank. There are two constraints. One, the boat can only take two people at most and it cannot operate without people. Two, whenever cannibals outnumber missionaries on each bank, missionaries get eaten.
